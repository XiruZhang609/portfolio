## About me 	`#0969DA`
My family's sporting talent nurtured my pursuit of team competition and team spirit. Then, it gradually enhanced by playing basketball and Multiplayer Online Battle Arena games (MOBA), which ignited my passion for animation and the athletic gaming industry. 

As a current graduate working on a Master's degree in Entertainment Industry Management from Carnegie Mellon University and a Bachelor's in Digital Media Arts, I bring a diverse skill set and a relentless passion for innovation to the table. Coupled with a solid knowledge foundation of video production, editing, project management, data and financial analysis, I am becoming both a content producer and a communicator who plans and disseminates brands.

At this stage, I am seeking work in the gaming and esports industry. I want to design and execute more socially responsible and circle-breaking IP linkages that transcend across the industry as a brand or content operator. Following this, I am eager to join the construction of the competition systems and make influential leagues. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to revolutionize the gaming industry.
