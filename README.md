# Xiru Zhang
Graduate student of Entertainment Industry Management at CMU
## About me
My family's sporting talent nurtured my pursuit of team competition and team spirit. Then, it gradually enhanced by playing basketball and Multiplayer Online Battle Arena games (MOBA), which ignited my passion for animation and the athletic gaming industry. 

As a current graduate working on a Master's degree in Entertainment Industry Management from Carnegie Mellon University and a Bachelor's in Digital Media Arts, I bring a diverse skill set and a relentless passion for innovation to the table. Coupled with a solid knowledge foundation of video production, editing, project management, data and financial analysis, I am becoming both a content producer and a communicator who plans and disseminates brands.

At this stage, I am seeking work in the gaming and esports industry. I want to design and execute more socially responsible and circle-breaking IP linkages that transcend across the industry as a brand or content operator. Following this, I am eager to join the construction of the competition systems and make influential leagues. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to revolutionize the gaming industry.
## What I hope to learn
I want to acquire skills in data visualization and the use of tools to increase my competitiveness in data analysis. In the entertainment industry, especially in the fast-growing industries such as gaming and e-sports, the data of players and viewers are enormous. I hope to be able to better understand the market changes and players' habits through data visualization and, at the same time, be able to present it to others more efficiently and convincingly so that I can be qualified for the position of operating from clubs to game IPs.
